      <h1>Girl with a Pearl Earring</h1>
      <div class="text-part">
        <p>
          Oil painting on canvas (c. 1665) by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer, one
          of his most well-known works. It depicts an imaginary young woman in
          exotic dress and a very large pearl earring. The work permanently
          resides in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague.

      <h1>Impression Sunrise by Claude Monet</h1>
      <div><img class="tab-image" src="sunrise.jpg" alt="home" /></div>
      <p>
        This famous painting, Impression, Sunrise, was created from a scene in
        the port of Le Havre. Monet depicts a mist, which provides a hazy
        background to the piece set in the French harbor. The orange and yellow
        hues contrast brilliantly with the dark vessels, where little, if any
        detail is immediately visible to the audience. It is a striking and
        candid work that shows the smaller boats in the foreground almost being
        propelled along by the movement of the water. This has, once again, been
        achieved by separate brushstrokes that also show various colors
        "sparkling" on the sea. From the 15th April to 15th May 1874 Monet
        exhibited his work together with Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley,
        Édouard Manet, Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, and some other thirty artists.
        They organized their exhibition on their own as they were usually
        rejected at the Paris Salon. Most visitors were disgusted and even
        outraged over such a graffiti. Monet's Impression, Sunrise enjoyed the
        most attention and some visitors even claimed that they were absolutely
        unable to recognize what was shown at all.

      <h1>The Kiss, by Gustav Klimt</h1>

      <img src="kiss.jpg" class="tab-image" alt="home" />
      <p>
        This well-loved work by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt depicts an
        embracing couple. The Kiss is a departure from Klimt’s other paintings,
        which mainly focused on women. Some art historians believe the couple
        portrayed here are Klimt himself and his long-time partner, Emilie
        Flöge. It’s a characteristic example of Klimt’s golden period style,
        during which he mixed gold leaf into his oil paints. The painting can be
        seen today at Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in
      </p>
      Vienna.
